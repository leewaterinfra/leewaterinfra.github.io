## Resilience â€¢ AI â€¢ Infrastructure â€¢ Systems â€¢ Education

## Vision

The R.A.I.S.E. framework represents a holistic approach to strengthening water and civil infrastructure through the responsible integration of emerging technologies, systems thinking, and transformative education. As our infrastructure systems face unprecedented challengesâ€”aging assets, climate change, resource constraints, and evolving demandsâ€”we need frameworks that bridge traditional engineering with cutting-edge innovation.

****Note: The R.A.I.S.E. framework has guided Dr. Lee's research across water infrastructure domains. Current work emphasizes the application of R.A.I.S.E. principles to building water distribution systems, digital twins, and autonomous control for integrated water-energy-quality (WEQ) optimization.*****

## The Five Pillars

### **R** - Resilience

**Building infrastructure that adapts, withstands, and recovers from disruptions**

Modern infrastructure must go beyond reliability to achieve true resilience. This pillar focuses on:

- **Predictive resilience**: Using data analytics to anticipate failures before they occur
- **Adaptive capacity**: Designing systems that respond dynamically to changing conditions
- **Recovery optimization**: Minimizing downtime and cascading failures during disruptions
- **Multi-hazard preparation**: Addressing climate change, wildfires, earthquakes, and human-caused events

**Key Research Areas:**
- Water infrastructure performance measurement
- Disaster response and recovery (Camp Fire contamination study)
- Asset management under uncertainty
- Climate adaptation strategies

---

### **A** - Artificial Intelligence

**Leveraging AI and advanced analytics for smarter infrastructure decisions**

AI and machine learning are transforming how we design, operate, and maintain infrastructure. This pillar explores:

- **Predictive analytics**: Forecasting failures, demand, and system behavior
- **Prescriptive analytics**: Optimizing operations for energy, cost, and water quality
- **Real-time monitoring**: Smart sensors and continuous data analysis
- **Decision support systems**: AI-assisted tools for complex infrastructure choices

**Key Research Areas:**
- Machine learning for water demand forecasting
- Neural networks for pipeline failure prediction
- Optimization algorithms for pump scheduling
- Data-driven asset management

---

### **I** - Infrastructure

**Advancing the physical systems that sustain our communities**

Infrastructure is the backbone of modern society. This pillar addresses:

- **Water distribution systems**: Pipes, pumps, treatment, and storage
- **Premise plumbing**: Building-level water systems and water quality
- **Smart infrastructure**: Sensor networks and digital twins
- **Asset management**: Strategic repair, rehabilitation, and replacement

**Key Research Areas:**
- Water main failure analysis and management
- Premise plumbing hydraulic and water quality modeling
- Service line material performance
- Infrastructure integrity programs

---

### **S** - Systems

**Thinking holistically about interconnected challenges**

Infrastructure doesn't exist in isolation. This pillar emphasizes:

- **Systems thinking**: Understanding complex interactions and feedback loops
- **Water-energy nexus**: Recognizing the interdependence of water and energy systems
- **Integrated planning**: Coordinating across utilities, agencies, and stakeholders
- **Sustainability**: Balancing economic, environmental, and social objectives

**Key Research Areas:**
- Multi-objective optimization
- Life cycle assessment of infrastructure materials
- Decentralized and hybrid water systems
- Non-revenue water reduction
- Water equity and environmental justice

---

### **E** - Education

**Preparing the next generation of infrastructure leaders**

The future of infrastructure depends on well-trained engineers who can navigate complexity. This pillar focuses on:

- **Curriculum innovation**: Integrating analytics, AI, and systems thinking into civil engineering education
- **Experiential learning**: Real-world projects and industry partnerships
- **Interdisciplinary training**: Bridging engineering with data science, policy, and economics
- **Lifelong learning**: Supporting continuous professional development

**Key Activities:**
- NSF-funded educational research on systems thinking and data analytics
- Development of new courses on water infrastructure analytics
- Mentoring graduate students and early-career professionals
- Industry-academic partnerships (California Water Service collaboration)
